            Cambridge's first college. Hugh Balsham, the archbishop, founded

            Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31
            semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic
            departments, faculties and other institutions organised into six
            schools. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the
            university, each controlling its own membership and with its own
            internal structure and activities. All students are members of a
            college. The university does not have a main campus, and its
            colleges and central facilities are scattered throughout the city.
            Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge centres on weekly small-group
            supervisions in the colleges in groups of typically 1–4 students.
            This intensive method of teaching is widely considered the 'jewel in
            the crown' of an Oxbridge undergraduate education.In addition,
            lectures, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further
            supervisions are provided by the central university faculties and
            departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided predominantly
            centrally.
          </p>
          <br />

            Cambridge University Press & Assessment combines the oldest and
            second-largest university press in the world with one of the world's
            leading examining bodies, which provides assessment to over eight
            million learners globally every year. The university also operates
            eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam
            Museum, as well as a botanic garden. Cambridge's libraries, of which
            there are over 100, hold a total of around 16 million books, around
            nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal
            deposit library. The university is home to, but independent of, the
            Cambridge Union – the world's oldest debating society. The
            university is closely linked to the development of the high-tech
            business cluster known as 'Silicon Fen', the largest technology
            cluster in Europe. It is the central member of Cambridge University
            Health Partners, an academic health science centre based around the
            Cambridge Biomedical Campus.

            By endowment size, Cambridge is the wealthiest university in Europe.
            In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university,
            excluding colleges, had a total income of £2.192 billion, of which
            £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.At the end of
            the same financial year, the central university and colleges
            together possessed a combined endowment of over £7.1 billion and
            overall consolidated net assets (excluding 'immaterial' historical
            assets) of over £12.5 billion. A member of numerous associations and
            part of the 'golden triangle' of English universities, Cambridge has
            educated many notable alumni, including eminent mathematicians,
            scientists, politicians, lawyers, philosophers, writers and actors.
            As of October 2020, 121 Nobel laureates, 11 Fields Medalists, 7
            Turing Award winners, 47 heads of state, and 14 British prime
            ministers have been affiliated with Cambridge as students, alumni,
            faculty or research staff. As of 2016, University alumni had won 194
            Olympic medals.
